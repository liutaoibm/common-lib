# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial project setup and structure
- Defining core logging interfaces and patterns
- Establishing baseline documentation

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure for maintaining project knowledge
- Defined initial project requirements and technical contexts
- Established system architecture patterns

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Node.js project structure
2. Set up development environment and tooling
3. Create basic logging interface prototypes
4. Implement core logging functionality
5. Develop transport mechanisms for different output destinations
6. Create documentation and examples

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Design Considerations
- Determine whether to design API in TypeScript or JavaScript
- Consider compatibility with popular existing logging solutions
- Decide on synchronous vs. asynchronous logging approaches
- Balance between simplicity and flexibility in the API design

### Implementation Considerations
- Evaluate existing logging libraries for inspiration and potential integration
- Consider performance implications of different logging approaches
- Determine optimal buffering and batching strategies
- Assess different serialization formats for structured logging

### Integration Considerations
- Ensure framework-agnostic design while providing helpers for popular frameworks
- Design for easy context propagation in async environments
- Consider integration with monitoring and observability tools

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Structure
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Minimal coupling between modules
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Configuration Approach
- Environment variable support
- Configuration file support
- Programmatic configuration
- Sensible defaults with minimal required configuration

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Initial research suggests winston and pino as leading Node.js logging libraries
- Structured logging (JSON) provides significant advantages for search and analysis
- Log rotation is critical for long-running services
- Context propagation is challenging in async environments
