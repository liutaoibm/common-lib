# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The organization needs to ensure that logging follows the same pattern and utilizes consistent output channels across all Node.js applications. Currently, each application may implement logging differently, leading to inconsistencies and challenges in log aggregation, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Solution
Develop a common logging library that can be integrated into any Node.js backend application to standardize the logging approach throughout the organization.

## Key Features
1. **Common Logging Initialization**
   - Standardized setup process
   - Consistent configuration options
   - Simple integration into existing applications

2. **Common Logging File Rotation Rules**
   - Unified log rotation policies
   - Configurable retention periods
   - Size-based and time-based rotation options

3. **Common Logging Patterns**
   - Standardized log formats
   - Consistent log levels
   - Structured logging for better searchability
   - Context enrichment (request IDs, user info, etc.)

## Expected Benefits
- Improved troubleshooting across applications
- Easier log aggregation and analysis
- Reduced implementation effort for development teams
- Consistent logging quality across all systems
