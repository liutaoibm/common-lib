# Project Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure has been established
- Project requirements and context have been defined
- System architecture and patterns have been outlined

## What's Left to Build
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Publish to NPM registry
- Integration with application frameworks (Express, NestJS, etc.)
- Advanced features like remote logging
- Performance optimization for high-volume logging

## Current Status
**Phase**: Implementation Complete

**Milestone**: Project Definition
- [x] Define project requirements
- [x] Outline system architecture
- [x] Document technical context
- [x] Initialize project repository
- [x] Set up development environment

**Milestone**: Core Implementation
- [x] Design logging interfaces
- [x] Implement base logging functionality
- [x] Implement transport mechanisms (Console, File)
- [x] Create configuration system

**Milestone**: Documentation and Testing
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Develop example applications
- [x] Implement test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

**Milestone**: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] HTTP/Remote transport
- [ ] Stream integration
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Integration modules for frameworks

## Known Issues
- File transport tests have limited coverage
- Need more extensive stress testing for high-volume logging scenarios

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Established a structured documentation approach to maintain project knowledge
2. **Modular Architecture**: Implemented a modular approach with separation between core logging, formatters, and transport mechanisms
3. **Documentation Focus**: Created comprehensive documentation in README and examples
4. **Built from Scratch**: Built the logging library from scratch rather than extending existing libraries
5. **TypeScript Implementation**: Used TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience
6. **Promise-based API**: Implemented async/await pattern for all logging methods
7. **Transport Priority**: Implemented console and file transports as the initial set
8. **Standard Log Format**: Defined structured log format with timestamp, level, message, namespace, and context

### Pending Decisions
1. **Remote Transport Implementation**: How to implement HTTP/remote logging transport
2. **Framework Integration**: How to best integrate with Express, NestJS, and other frameworks
3. **Performance Optimization Strategy**: Approach for optimizing high-volume logging
