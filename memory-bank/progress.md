# Project Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure has been established
- Project requirements and context have been defined
- System architecture and patterns have been outlined

## What's Left to Build
- Project initialization and repository setup
- Core logging functionality
- Transport mechanisms for different output destinations
- Configuration system
- Documentation and examples
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- NPM package configuration

## Current Status
**Phase**: Planning and Initial Setup

**Milestone**: Project Definition
- [x] Define project requirements
- [x] Outline system architecture
- [x] Document technical context
- [ ] Initialize project repository
- [ ] Set up development environment

**Milestone**: Core Implementation
- [ ] Design logging interfaces
- [ ] Implement base logging functionality
- [ ] Implement transport mechanisms
- [ ] Create configuration system

**Milestone**: Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Develop example applications
- [ ] Implement test suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues
- No issues identified yet as the project is in initial setup phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Established a structured documentation approach to maintain project knowledge
2. **Modular Architecture**: Decided on a modular approach with separation between core logging and transport mechanisms
3. **Documentation Focus**: Emphasized the importance of comprehensive documentation for library adopters

### Pending Decisions
1. **Base Logging Library**: Whether to build from scratch or extend an existing library
2. **TypeScript vs. JavaScript**: Whether to use TypeScript for development
3. **Logging Format Standard**: Defining the standard format for log entries
4. **Transport Priority**: Which transport mechanisms to prioritize in implementation
