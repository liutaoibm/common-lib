# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Primary Technology
- **Node.js**: Latest version used as the foundation for the library
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Core programming language(s) for implementation

### Supporting Technologies
- **npm**: Package manager for distribution and dependency management
- **Winston/Pino** (potential): Established logging frameworks that could be leveraged or used as reference
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks for ensuring reliability
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting standardization

## Technical Constraints

### Integration Requirements
- Must be installable to other applications via npm/yarn
- Should work with minimal configuration in standard Node.js environments
- Must support both CommonJS and ES Modules
- Should play well with popular frameworks (Express, NestJS, etc.)

### Performance Considerations
- Logging must not significantly impact application performance
- Should handle high-volume logging scenarios
- Need to consider memory usage, especially for long-running services

### Compatibility
- Must support current LTS versions of Node.js
- Consider forward compatibility with upcoming Node.js releases
- Should not conflict with other common libraries

## Documentation

### API Documentation
- Comprehensive API reference with examples
- JSDoc comments for all public methods and classes
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Type definitions for TypeScript users

### Integration Guides
- Quick start guides for common frameworks (Express, NestJS, etc.)
- Step-by-step integration instructions
- Configuration examples for different environments (development, production)
- Best practices for efficient logging

### Examples
- Complete working examples for different scenarios
- Sample configurations for common use cases
- Demo applications demonstrating integration patterns

### Documentation Format
- Markdown files in the repository
- Generated HTML documentation
- Interactive examples where appropriate
- Versioned documentation that matches library releases

### Documentation Tools
- JSDoc/TypeDoc for API documentation
- Documentation website generation
- README templates for consistent structure
- Changelog automation

## Development Environment

### Recommended Setup
- Node.js LTS or later
- npm or yarn for package management
- Code editor with JavaScript/TypeScript support
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### Build & Test Process
- Automated tests via CI/CD
- Code quality checks integrated into the development workflow
- Version management following semver principles
